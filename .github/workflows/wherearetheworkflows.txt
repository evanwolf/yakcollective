for testing reasons (and prevent continuous netlify rebuildings)
the workflows are being tested on tilnow/testbot
the way it works now is that 
the workflow "testbranches" runs in the master, but it then exceutes a bash file and then a python file that are in the branch (now abranch, later knack-migration and even later, maybe in the main branch)
then the script generates an artifact (the mebers.json file)
the python reads the data from knack
fixes it up and sends it back to knack to be served
it send the serving link to a local file which is a commit, which can actually be used to trigger the netlify build
the python also (well, soon) will read discord data and update the knack if/when needed.
